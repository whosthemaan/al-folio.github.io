Hi! I am a second year Robotics graduate student at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research interests lies in `Computer Vision` especially on understanding and furthering the development of generative models. Following my masters, I am looking forward to starting my PhD with the aim to solve `hallucinations in Generative models`. I want to solve data scarcity and build a bottom-up physics inspired generative model capable of capturing multi-modal inputs(sound and images) to create a super-real environment for the development of MetaVerse.

In 2018, I graduated with a bachelors in `Robotics and Automation` from MIT WPU, Pune. I had the opportunity to learn embedded systems and Robotic system development from scratch. I have worked with Texas Instruments M4 and Atmel 2560 microcontrollers to perform macro robotic operations such as pick and place. High level task such as perception/planning involved ROS for task syncronization.

My undergraduate degree thesis was on automation of aerial manipulator. A custom MPC based controller designed specifically for a dynamic system like `Aerial Manipulator` to perform mid-air pick and place operations. This work was a part of Indo-Korea joint venture work held at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.
